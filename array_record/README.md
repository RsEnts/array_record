# ArrayRecord

ArrayRecord is a new file format derived from
[Riegeli](https://github.com/google/riegeli), achieving a new
frontier of IO efficiency. We designed ArrayRecord to support parallel read,
write, and random access by record index.
ArrayRecord builds on top of Riegeli and supports the same compression
algorithms.
